# Typhoon drum machine

A project in Overtone to recreate the Dave Smith Instruments Tempest drum machine
in software.

## Development

Feel free to fork and help develop it, or take it in different directions.
The goal is to make this a community project, and let people build all sorts
of different interfaces for it.

It helps a lot to checkout the Tempest user manual and demo videos here:
